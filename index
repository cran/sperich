species.richness.main 		The main function to estimate or cross-validate the species richness based on given species occurrences.
species.richness 		Estimates the species richness based on given species occurrences.
species.richness.nonweighted	Estimates the species richness for a given distance based on given species occurrences without using weighting factor.
species.richness.cv		Cross-validates the species richness based on given species occurrences.
species.range			Estimates the species range based on given occurrences of one species.
extract.species 		Extracts the datasets of one species out of a database filled with species and their occurrence locations.
getDimension			Calculates the dimension of the grid which should be used for a species richness estimation.
getShift			Calculates the origin of the grid used for a species richness estimation.
getDistance			Calculates the distance of two points in a grid.
data.into.Grid		Adds the species occurrence data to a new grid with given dimension, shift and resolution.
add.Edges			Adds an edge between two points to a grid.
edgeNotValid			Checks if an edge would cross a water or mountain surface.
fill.Areas			Fills all bounded areas in a grid.
createLandwatermask		Creates a land-water-mask as a grid based on given dimension and coordinates.
createHeightmask		Creates a height-mask as a grid based on given dimension and coordinates.
generate.subsamples		Creates an array of subsamples of a dataset.
createImage			Creates a levelplot of the result-grid of species range estimation and saves it as a PNG-File.
evaluate 			Evaluates the result grids of species richness estimation and creates a PNG-File with histogramm and statistic information.
exportAsGDAL			Exports the result grid as a GDAL grid map.
createNonInterpolatedGrid	Creates a grid containing the species occurrences.
adjustment			Adjusts the weighted species richness for sampling effort.
searchClusters		Searches clusters in the result grid of species richness estimation.
getNarrowEndemics		Extracts the row number of narrow endemic species in the given dataset.
